		<h1>UK Grid Proportions</h1>
		<h3>The UK is moving towards more responsible sources of energy! These pie charts show the progress.</h3>
		<p>
			Note: The charts show a limited amount of sources, and percentages shown are proportional to the total of the sources shown - the core takeaway is the decrease in coal, and increase in wind and solar. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The pie charts are made with 'conic-gradient', a new and fairly unsupported CSS feature (works in Chrome and Safari).
