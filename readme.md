## The UK is moving towards more responsible sources of energy! These pie charts show the progress.

Note: The charts show a limited amount of sources, and percentages shown are proportional to the total of the sources shown - the core takeaway is the decrease in coal, and increase in wind and solar. 

The pie charts are made with 'conic-gradient', a new and fairly unsupported CSS feature (works in Chrome and Safari).
